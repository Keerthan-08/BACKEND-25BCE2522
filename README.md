# BACKEND-25BCE2522
GDG 2025/26 BACKEND Round 2 (Incomplete)
I’d like to walk you through the project. I dedicated the majority of my time to the AIML component, which was my primary focus and area of interest. I believe that part is solid.

Regarding the backend, I have to be honest—I wasn't able to complete it to the level I wanted.
Since I was learning Django and MongoDB from scratch without support, the time constraints were just too tight. 
I have some generated code and a basic structure, but the backend task remains unfinished. 
I prioritized ensuring the AI model itself was working correctly rather than submitting a broken backend integration.
I attempted to build the integration using Django and MongoDB, but since I was learning these tools on the fly, I couldn't complete the full implementation in time.
I used GenAI to help understand the flow and generate some boilerplate, but debugging the integration took longer than expected.
So, while the AI logic is ready, the backend connection is currently incomplete

But i will make sure i will work on that as well in future days
